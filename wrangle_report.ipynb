    "This was the most demanding part of the project, I proceeded at first with the given steps in the instructions through API authentification. I kept getting unknown errors and couldn't figure out why for a long time. Untill a mentor told me it is because twitter changed the levels of developer access and I would need an enhanced level to use this code. \n",

    "Then I tried to apply for the enhanced access, and even though it was granted for couple days, the code still did not work, not sure why.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was quite frustrated at this point and needed additional mentor help to figure out another approach. There were some posts in the knoweldge center, I replicated the approach but it still did not work and I kept getting uknown errors, until the mentors helped me after two days effort and long communication thread, to figure out the issues there.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be honest this was super frustrating part of the project for me, took a long time and a lot of anger. I think it would be nice from you to update the additional resources part in the instructions to inform the people that this approach that is listed there no longer works and help students figure out the other approach because to be honest just after absolving the course if was not easy to figure this out. Without the mentors help I would not be able to do this."
